This is the project to update and revamp my personal website.

At the time of writing this, (2023, January 1, 18:00 IST) this is a very basic HTML site with no CSS styling or much of any special formatting.

The goal of this project is to change that, and make it appear like I am a Competent Programmer who actually knows how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps.
